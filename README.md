# Computer-Graphics-Solar-System
The aim of this project is to show the shadow implementation using OPENGL which
include Movement, Light properties and also transformation operations like translation, rotation,
scaling etc on objects. The package must also have a user friendly interface.

# Computer Graphics
Graphics provides one of the most natural means of communicating with a computer,
since our highly developed 2D and 3D pattern recognition abilities allow us to perceive and
process pictorial data rapidly and efficiently. Interactive computer graphics is the most important
means of producing pictures since the invention of photography and television. It has the added
advantage that, with the computer, we can make pictures not only of concrete real world objects
but also of abstract, synthetic objects, such as mathematical surfaces and of data that have no
inherent geometry, such as survey results.

# User Interface:
## Keyboard Based Interface
Using the keyboard user can make the planets to rotate on their own axis and revolve
round the Sun. The stars are made to twinkle and the Comet is made to revolve round the Sun.
* The keys m, v, e, r, j, s, u, n are used to rotate the planets.
* The keys M, V, E, R, J, S, U, N are used to revolve the planets around the Sun.
* The key z rotates the sun, B gives both the rotation and revolution of the planets around the
rotating Sun with a Comet revolution and Stars twinkle.
* Pressing the key A revolves all the planets and comet and the key a rotates all the planets
around the rotating Sun with Stars twinkling in the background.

# Scope
It is developed in ECLIPSE. It has been implemented on UBUNTU platform. The
3-D graphics package designed here provides an interface for the users for handling the display
and manipulation of Celestial Exploratory. The Keyboard is the main input device used.
